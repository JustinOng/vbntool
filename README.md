# vbntool

A tool to extract data and the quarantined file from .vbn files created by Symantec Endpoint Protection.

This tool was built almost entirely off information from https://malwaremaloney.blogspot.com/2018/03/symantec-endpoint-protection-vbn-files.html

# Requirements

Python 3

# Usage

```
> python vbntool.py -h
usage: vbntool.py [-h] [-v] [-l] [-i] [-o [OUTPUT]] vbn_file

Parse a Symantec Quarantine File (*.vbn)

positional arguments:
  vbn_file              Provide a .vbn file to extract information from

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v, --verbose         Enable verbose output
  -l, --logline         Displays metadata from the embedded log line
  -i, --ignore          Extract quarantine file even if hash does not match
  -o [OUTPUT], --output [OUTPUT]
                        Name to save quarantined file as. Defaults to original
                        name if this flag is provided without a value
```

The tool will just print information about the file if no arguments are provided:

```
> python vbntool.py 5D4A3899.VBN
[INFO ] Loaded 5D4A3899.VBN (109428 bytes)
[INFO ] Quarantined File was at: C:\Users\a\Desktop\2019-06-12-malware-EXE-from-80.85.155.70.exe
[INFO ] Quarantine File created at 2019-06-19T21:28:57
[INFO ] Quarantined File has SHA1 hash: 2552e23ba01ccbfa9f8cf5a8b4ef29b8173cfe0e
[INFO ] Quarantined File has size: 100352 bytes
[INFO ] Quarantine file hash verified ok
[INFO ] Pass -o/--output to extract the quarantined file
```

## Extracting Quarantined File
To extract the quarantined file, pass the `-o/--output` argument. If `-o/--output` is specified without a file name, the initial file name is used:

```
> python vbntool.py 5D4A3899.VBN -o
[INFO ] Loaded 5D4A3899.VBN (109428 bytes)
[INFO ] Quarantined File was at: C:\Users\a\Desktop\2019-06-12-malware-EXE-from-80.85.155.70.exe
[INFO ] Quarantine File created at 2019-06-19T21:28:57
[INFO ] Quarantined File has SHA1 hash: 2552e23ba01ccbfa9f8cf5a8b4ef29b8173cfe0e
[INFO ] Quarantined File has size: 100352 bytes
[INFO ] Quarantine file hash verified ok
[INFO ] Writing 100352 bytes to 2019-06-12-malware-EXE-from-80.85.155.70.exe
```

If a file name is specified, it is used instead:

```
> python vbntool.py 5D4A3899.VBN -o out.exe
[INFO ] Loaded 5D4A3899.VBN (109428 bytes)
[INFO ] Quarantined File was at: C:\Users\a\Desktop\2019-06-12-malware-EXE-from-80.85.155.70.exe
[INFO ] Quarantine File created at 2019-06-19T21:28:57
[INFO ] Quarantined File has SHA1 hash: 2552e23ba01ccbfa9f8cf5a8b4ef29b8173cfe0e
[INFO ] Quarantined File has size: 100352 bytes
[INFO ] Quarantine file hash verified ok
[INFO ] Writing 100352 bytes to out.exe
```

The tool will warn if the file hash stated in the .vbn file differs from the hash of the extracted file. Pass the `-i/--ignore` argument to extract the quarantined file anyway

```
> python vbntool.py 5D4A3899.VBN -o
[INFO ] Loaded 5D4A3899.VBN (109428 bytes)

[WARNING] Pass -i/--ignore to extract the quarantined file anyway
```

# Log Line

The .vbn file contains a log line that provides a context for the quarantined file. Pass `-l/--logline` to print this logline:

```
> python vbntool.py 5D4A3899.VBN -l
